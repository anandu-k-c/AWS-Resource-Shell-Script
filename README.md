## Shell Scripting automation project for DevOps Engineers for Resource Listings in AWS account

### Project: AWS Resource Listing via Shell Script

In this project, we develop a shell script that connects to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and lists the active resources for a specified service. The script leverages AWS CLI to interface with AWS services, allowing users to retrieve and display currently running resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, etc.

The key features of the project include:

	•	AWS CLI Integration: The script interacts with AWS services through AWS CLI, making it lightweight and easy to use.
	•	Dynamic Service Selection: Users can specify the AWS service they want to query (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS).
	•	Resource Listing: The script retrieves details about active resources, such as instance IDs, status, and other service-specific details.
	•	Error Handling: It includes basic error handling for cases where no active resources exist or when AWS credentials are misconfigured.

This project serves as an automated, command-line tool for cloud administrators or developers to quickly view the status of their AWS resources from a terminal.
